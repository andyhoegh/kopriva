## Detection Probability

- In biological settings, many organisms are elusive or hard to detect
- Not identifying the organism does not mean it is not present
- Understanding _detection probability_ is essential for monitoring programs
- Statistics (occupancy models) can be used to estimate detection probability

## Detection Probability for Zebra Mussels

Depends on characteristics of the water body

```{r, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("detection_fig.png")
```

## Sampling Intensity

Almost certainly need to increase sampling intensity

```{r, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("DetectionProb.png")
```

## Sampling Intensity

Testing samples from individual tows provides better estimate of detection probability

```{r, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("tow_data.png")

## Goal: Develop computationally-efficient software for eDNA surveillance

## Data Collection

```{r, out.width = "650px"}
knitr::include_graphics("Data.png")
```

## EDNA Data Structure

>- Presence Data: 
```{r, out.width = "50px"}
knitr::include_graphics("positive.png")
```
Species occurs AND species is detected with eDNA
	
- Absence Data:
```{r, out.width = "50px"}
knitr::include_graphics("negative.png")
```
Species does not occur OR species is not detected with eDNA.

## Multiscale Occupancy Model

Two detection probabilities are necessary

>1. probability of detecting eDNA in bottle, given it is at site 
```{r, out.width = "50px"}
knitr::include_graphics("bottle.png")
```

2. probability of detecting eDNA in the pipette, given it is in bottle 
```{r, out.width = "50px"}
knitr::include_graphics("positive.png")
```

## Efficient Computation and Software

## Animal Movement Models

- Step Length: is a distribution for distance traveled in a specific period

- Angular Direction:\
```{r, out.width = '400px', }
data.vm <- rvonmises(n=1000, mu=circular(0), kappa=3) 

# Plot data set. All points do not fit on plot.
plot(data.vm, stack=TRUE, bins=150, main = 'Histogram of Angular Data') 

```

## Collective Movement and Agent Based Models

-Collective animal movement refers to a situation where animals influence each others behavior.

- Agent based models are a simulation based approach using a set of _agents_.
- Each agent is given a relatively simple set of rules, which control interactions between agents.
- The collective behavior of agents can model complex population level characteristics.


## Independent Model

## Collective Model

```


## Findings

- We found that bears tended to switch from an "home range state" to an "exploring state" when other bears were in the proximity.

- Still working to include spatial covariates

```

## Data structure

```{r, out.width = "900px"}
knitr::include_graphics("sage_data.png")
```


## Data Challenges

>- We are interested in detecting changes across time; however, _changes_ is difficult to describe.

- Changes would refer to comparisons across a set of grids with different species (60ish).

- Changes are not as simple as more or less of a specific species of sagebrush, but rather focuses on the composition of the community of plants.

## Sampling Effort Questions

- How often and how many frames need to be monitored?

- How to make comparisons between grids from different locations or times, given all of the different species?


## Projection and Clustering

```{r, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("ord.png")
```

## Monitoring Plan 

- Climate change related impacts will not be expected to vary dramatically from year-to-year

- The composition of plant species can be projected into lower dimension to assess similarity. Differences can be assessed visually or with quantitative metrics.

- Fewer grids/frames required on a yearly basis to identify large structural population differences.
